**_Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie_**
## PyBank

* In this challenge, I am tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company. We have a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* My final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file **_(PyBank/Analysis/budget_analysis.txt)_** with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

* I am given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* My final script checks for (a) Voter ID fraud (b) checks if there is a tie (c) reports the runner up and  (d) prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file **_(PyPoll/Analysis/election_analysis.txt)_** with the results.
